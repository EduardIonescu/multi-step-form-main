## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-   Complete each step of the sequence
-   See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
-   View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
-   See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
-   [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### What I learned

-In this project I've practiced React and how to manage State when it holds and sets nested objects and arrays. I've used CSS Modules to style my components, which was quite difficult at first, but it ended up making the whole project more manageable and easier to structure. The same can be said about structuring my Components.
-I've also practiced how to create a Form and throw errors on invalid input in React. It was probably not the best way, but I made it work.
-How to deploy a Nextjs app using Vercel.

### Continued development

-   Continue learning React and Nextjs.
-   Work with API's and databases in React.
-   Learn React Form Hook and try it in practice.
-   I am quite thrilled to try a styling framework like MaterialUI or TailwindCSS

### Useful resources

-   [React Docs BETA](https://beta.reactjs.org/) - This helped me learn standard for React and how to better manage State and Props.
-   [NextJS Docs](https://nextjs.org/learn/foundations/about-nextjs) - This taught me how to use NextJS and how to somewhat structure it's folders and files.
